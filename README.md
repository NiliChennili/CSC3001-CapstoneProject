# Project Description: 
A UI/UX web-based solution that displays a 2D and 3D geographical map that lets users visualize and compare different data sources in real-time. It also serves as an interactive visualization tool that will enable users to view comprehensive information and insights on the selected area on the maps. This interface will leverage existing cybersecurity statistical data from the database to provide real-time cybersecurity statistics on an intuitive and easy-to-use geographical map dashboard.
